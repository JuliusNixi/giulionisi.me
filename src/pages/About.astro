    <br>
    <p>
      Hello visitor, on this page you will find some information about me...
      <br><br>
      My name is <span class="text-primary">Giulio</span> Nisi, and I was born in <span class="text-primary">2001</span> in <span class="text-primary">Lucca</span>, Tuscany, Italy. <br>
      I love <span class="text-primary">walking</span> on its walls in solitude in the evening.
      <br><br>
      I attended an Economic Technical Institute with an emphasis in computer science.
      I am currently studying <span class="text-primary">Computer Science</span> at the University of Pisa.
      <br><br>
      I am determined in <span class="text-primary">solving</span> the problems I am interested in.
      <br><br>
      I like animals, particularly <span class="text-primary">dogs</span> and even more specifically, Golden Retrievers and Border Collies.
      <br><br>
      I enjoy <span class="text-primary">eating</span>, tasting new flavors and recipes.
      I am an avid consumer of sugar-free <span class="text-primary">coffee</span>; its bitter taste sends me into ecstasy.
      <br><br>
      I love <span class="text-primary">sleeping</span>, although I wish I could do it for fewer hours thus having more time with which to cultivate my interests.
      <br><br>
      I appreciate <span class="text-primary">traveling</span> to explore new cultures and museums.
      <br><br>
      One of my downsides is that, being a <span class="text-primary">perfectionist</span>, I am a bit slow.
      Another downside is my tendency to <span class="text-primary">procastinate</span> on what I think is exhausting.
      However, I am working on improving myself. 
      <br><br>
      <span class="text-primary">Creativity</span> is part of me, ever since I was a child I dreamed of becoming a science fiction/fantasy writer.
      <br><br>
      When I was 9 years old, my mother took me to her office and I was enchanted by her computer.
      I thought that thanks to that machine I would be able to shape what until then had been confined to my mind.
      So, after a series of endless requests, I convinced her to give me a PC for my promotion from elementary to middle school in 2012.
      This would become my faithful friend from whom I never parted.
      <br><br>
      Thanks to Minecraft, a video game of which I was a fan, at age 14 I got into <span class="text-primary">programming</span> with Java and Linux.
      The former to develop mods, the latter to host game servers. 
      At the same time I studied <span class="text-primary">music</span> and piano.
      I have used both scholastically/academically and self-taught VB.NET, Python, C/C++, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL.
      <br><br>
      I tend to be very <span class="text-primary">curious</span> and have a variety of passions.
      Some are: <span class="text-primary">finance</span> and markets, music and playing piano/violin, <span class="text-primary">movies</span>, <span class="text-primary">board games</span> and RPGs, video games, <span class="text-primary">aviation</span>, and more. 
      <br><br>
      I think I meet the definition of <span class="text-primary"><a class="underline" href="https://shm.to/RDXznXc">multipotential</a></span>. 
      <br><br>
      I like <span class="text-primary">simplicity</span> and minimalism (when it does not become an extremist ideology).
      <br><br>
      My favourite color is <span class="text-primary">blue</span>.
      <br><br>
      I <span class="text-primary">hate fundamentalism</span> in the broader sense of the term, on the contrary I support <span class="text-primary">critical thinking</span>.
